** parametrize the configuration

** instead of agent, any type that can be showed and compared (Eq, Show)
** optimize it
*** DONE maybe data.map.strict, because I use all the value.

    - can't see a diff.
*** do cat world.prof to see what the problem is. 
    - currently, it's checking for neighbors all the time in neighbors.
    - ask stackoverflow how to improve performance.
    - figure out another algorithm to get all the neigbors in one
      pass:
      - go over each cell, find members, but, also add the duplicate
        entries, so that if a is neigmbor to b, b is neighbor to a.

*** I should move all the Entry stuff out to only do once, for the display, then have the everything else using an intmap or a map
